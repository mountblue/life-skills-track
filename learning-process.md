## Learning Principles in the Bootcamp

### Doing things with 100% involvement

* Programming is essentially a result of your sustained and concentrated attention
* Preserving attention is a skill that you can get better with time
* Read up on deep work - [https://doist.com/blog/deep-work/](https://doist.com/blog/deep-work/)
* Work when you work, play when you play is a good thumb rule.
* Always keep your phone on silent. Remove notifications from the home screen. Only keep notifications for work-related apps.
* You should strongly consider blocking social media sites and apps during work hours. Tools like TimeLimit, Freedom, or any other app can be helpful.
* We recommend tracking your time using app like [Boosted](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.boostedproductivity.app&hl=en_IN) to improve productivity.

### Stuck? Ask questions

* The way you ask a question determines whether it will be answered or not. You need to make it very easy for the person to answer your question. Messages like the database is not connecting, need your help or the build is not working, can you help me out, will not get you the answers you are looking for.
* Explain the problem clearly, mention the solutions you tried out to fix the problem
* Use screenshots, diagrams, screencasts tools like loom to show and explain
* Use Github gists to share code snippets. Use sandbox environments like Codepen, Codesandbox to share the entire setup
* Look at the way issues get reported in large open-source projects.

### Always over-communicate: Some scenarios

* Join the meetings 5-10 mins early
* Requirements have changed? - If the current deadline will not be met due to the changes, inform relevant team members about the new deadline
* No internet/electricity/laptop not working - Inform relevant team members
* Implementation taking longer than usual due to some unexpected issue - Inform relevant team members
* Use the group chat/channels to communicate most of the time. This is preferable over private DMs simply because there are more eyes on the main channel.
* Do not miss calls. If you cannot talk immediately, receive the call and inform them you will call in back in 5-10 min, and call them back. This is a much better alternative than letting it go down as a missed call.
* In meetings, keep your video turned on. It will improve the rapport with your team and help improve communication.

### Be aware and mindful of other team members

* It will not always be possible for your team members to get on a call with you. Instead, you can send a slack, Whatsapp message. But instead of bombarding them with many messages, you can write down all the questions you have and send it as a single message
* Be available when someone replies to your message. Things move faster if it's a real-time conversation as compared to a back and forth every hour.
* Remember they have their own work to do as well. Pick and choose your communication medium depending on the situation
