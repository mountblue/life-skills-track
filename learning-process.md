## Learning Principles in the Bootcamp

### Doing things with 100% involvement

* Programming is essentially a result of your sustained and concentrated attention.
* Preserving attention is a skill that you can get better with time.
* Read up on deep work - [https://doist.com/blog/deep-work/](https://doist.com/blog/deep-work/)
* Work when you work, play when you play is a good thumb rule.
* Always keep your phone on silent. Remove notifications from the home screen. Only keep notifications for work-related apps.
* You should strongly consider blocking social media sites and apps during work hours. Tools like TimeLimit, Freedom, or any other app can be helpful.
* We recommend tracking your time using app like [Boosted](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.boostedproductivity.app&hl=en_IN) to improve productivity.

### How to learn Software Concepts

1. Where is this concept used or applied?
2. What is the concept? Can I explain it to someone in my own words?
3. How can I implement it in code or designt?
4. By when do I need to complete the practice drills or assignment or project for this topic?

Few points to keep in mind:
- The deadlines are only a tool for you to allocate certain time for the topics.
- Focus on the concept. Approach it with curiosity and joy.
- Make the process of learning fun and easy for you.
- Make the concept your own. Your own words, your own way of understanding it, your own code.
- You know a concept well when you can teach it. If someone wakes you up at 3 am in the night for some software issue, you can easily fix it and go to sleep.
- You may not have skill in everything in the world. If you master a few skills very well, you will be successful.
