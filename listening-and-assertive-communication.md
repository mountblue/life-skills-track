[Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_listening) - Read this first

Reflective listening is used widely in different situations. It is a subset of Active Listening with more emphasis on mirroring body language, emotions and verifying the message.

* In critical situations e.g. conversations between Air Traffic Controller and Pilots, conversations in military missions
* In business meetings - notes are taken by a notetaker and then verified by the participants
* To diffuse emotionally charged conversations in personal relationships

### Application to Business/Software Context

* Always take notes in meetings
* Share the notes with all stakeholders - client, manager or team members and ask them if there is a mistake
* Make sure the team is on the same page i.e. everyone agrees on the points discussed
* Take notes whenever you are in a technical discussion because there are minute details that might slip from the mind when you get down to implementing
