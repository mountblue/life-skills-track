The image below lists the four emotional quadrants:

[Emotional Quadrant](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335191634/figure/fig2/AS:792212367486976@1565889555183/Modified-PA-plane-with-four-emotional-quadrants.jpg)

The idea is to remain in the Excitement, Stress and Calm quadrants for a more happy, calm and engaging life.

Stress is an inevitable part of life. We get stressed whether learning something new or doing an intense workout. But staying stressed too long can cause a burnout or make us anxious and depressed.

If we welcome stress with the right mindset and then switch to activities in Calm quadrant to relax and recover, we can get the best out of life.

We will discuss this central idea in this session.

Understanding your own self is a crucial part of the whole process.
