# Email Communication

Writing Good Emails

## Intention

* To write professional emails.
* To keep email short and crisp.
* Using bullet points to cut out fluff and do precise communication.
* Otherwise using complete sentences.
* Express one's needs in writing.
* Understanding and upholding the receiver's need while sender crafts the message.
* To keep a list of email templates ready to be used in future situations.

Please go through the first video (36:11 minutes) very carefully. This contains all the relevant information.

In the interactive session, I would like to focus on email reviews. You have to send 6 emails to my email id before the session. Please look at the bottom section of this email for instructions.

#### Bullet Points

Go through these two links on bullet points:
* [Improve Email productivity with Bullet Points](https://www.getorganizedwizard.com/blog/2010/11/improve-email-productivity-with-bullet-points/)
* [Best practices for Bullet Points](https://www.businesswritingblog.com/business_writing/2005/12/the_best_of_bul.html)

Use bullet points for conveying information. They need not be grammatically correct.

Don't say: I completed writing Tasks controller.
Say: Completed Tasks controller.

Use complete sentences when writing down conversational communication. Like requesting for access or requesting leaves.

* No space before punctuation. Single space before punctuation.
* Capitalisation only in proper nouns, start of sentence or  abbreviation
* Use proper bullet point. Use the button in the email editor.
* Don't use extra sentences. Keep emails short and crisp.
* If you are making a request or asking for clarification, ask a clear direct question.
